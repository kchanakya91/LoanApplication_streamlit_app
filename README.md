# LoanApplication_streamlit_app

This project is about loan prediction.
The main profit of loans comes directly from the loan's interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don't have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.
I build a predictive model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the loan status of an applicant, the mission is to prepare a web app to make it available in production.
